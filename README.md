# Personalised Cohort Learning Platform

This repository contains the full stack application for a personalised cohort learning platform, divided into two main components:

- `task-100x-backend/`: The backend API built with Python.
- `task-100x/`: The frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

Each component has its own `README.md` file with specific instructions for setup, development, and deployment.
